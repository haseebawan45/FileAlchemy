# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the FileAlchemy file conversion web application from Fly.io to Railway's free tier. The migration must optimize the application to work within Railway's free tier limitations while maintaining core functionality and ensuring cost-effective deployment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate from Fly.io to Railway's free tier, so that I can reduce hosting costs while maintaining application functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed to Railway THEN it SHALL run within the free tier resource limits (512MB RAM, 0.5 vCPU)
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the application SHALL maintain all core file conversion features
3. WHEN deployed on Railway THEN the application SHALL have proper environment configuration
4. WHEN the deployment is successful THEN the application SHALL be accessible via Railway's provided URL

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to optimize the application for Railway's free tier, so that it performs efficiently within resource constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL use less than 512MB of RAM during normal operation
2. WHEN processing files THEN the application SHALL implement memory-efficient processing techniques
3. WHEN handling large files THEN the application SHALL use streaming or chunked processing to avoid memory overflow
4. WHEN multiple conversions run THEN the application SHALL queue requests to prevent resource exhaustion
5. WHEN the application is idle THEN it SHALL minimize resource usage to stay within free tier limits

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure Railway-specific deployment settings, so that the application deploys correctly on the new platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to Railway THEN the application SHALL use Railway-compatible configuration files
2. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL read environment variables from Railway's environment
3. WHEN building the application THEN it SHALL use Railway's build process efficiently
4. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL bind to Railway's assigned port correctly
5. WHEN static files are served THEN they SHALL be accessible through Railway's hosting

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain application functionality while reducing resource usage, so that users can still perform file conversions effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users upload files THEN the application SHALL enforce stricter file size limits appropriate for free tier
2. WHEN processing heavy operations THEN the application SHALL implement timeout mechanisms
3. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the application SHALL implement cleanup procedures
4. WHEN conversions fail due to resource limits THEN the application SHALL provide clear error messages
5. WHEN the application handles requests THEN it SHALL prioritize lightweight conversion methods

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement monitoring and optimization features, so that I can ensure the application stays within free tier limits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL log memory usage and performance metrics
2. WHEN resource usage approaches limits THEN the application SHALL implement throttling mechanisms
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the application SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
4. WHEN the application processes files THEN it SHALL clean up temporary files immediately after use
5. WHEN monitoring the application THEN developers SHALL have access to performance and resource usage data

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work reliably on Railway, so that I can continue using the file conversion service without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the application THEN it SHALL load within reasonable time limits
2. WHEN I upload files for conversion THEN the process SHALL complete successfully within resource constraints
3. WHEN conversions are processing THEN I SHALL receive progress updates and status information
4. WHEN errors occur THEN I SHALL receive clear, user-friendly error messages
5. WHEN the application is under load THEN it SHALL handle requests gracefully without crashing
